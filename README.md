# Technical approach

## 1. Project Goals, Objectives, and Task Definition

EngagePoint understands the design, development, and implementation required to develop a prototype (using open source technologies) in which foster parents perform case-related functions. This prototype, an automated modern web application, scales horizontally and can be deployed to an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider.

## 2. User-centric design approach

EngagePoint applied user-centric design principles in creating the prototype by following the US Digital Services Playbook. See the responses in Playbook (Play 1 - Play 3) and Requirements C - F for information.

## 3. Agile Methodology

To implement the prototype, we modified our Scrum methodology to align with the user-centric design. Our approach is detailed in our response to Requirement G and US Digital Services Playbook Play 4.

## 4. Technical architecture

EngagePoint selected the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform and Java 1.8 as the prototype's programming language. The JVM platform is commonly used in high-load web applications, such as Google. However, small prototype web applications can be created quickly and then transitioned to production usage on the same technology platform without having to rewrite the application.

Using the JVM platform for prototype development is the correct choice due to scalability and maturity of Java as an industry standard.

We adhere to these factors to maximize performance:

- Leverage a generic application platform for prototype construction
- Use code generators rather than boilerplate code
- Minimize time for the code-compile-test-deploy cycle

To minimize risk, we considered these factors for each system architecture component:

- Maturity level
- Success stories
- Documentation quality
- Cloud readiness
- Performance metrics
- Maintenance costs

### 4.1. Application Platform

EngagePoint used the open source code generator  [JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/), which let us generate a production-ready application using  [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and  [AnglarJS](https://angularjs.org/), which contain monitoring, logging, configuration, and user management functionality.

JHipster lets us choose technologies based on project requirements. For the prototype, EngagePoint chose this technology stack:

![Architectural diagram](https://github.com/engagepoint/chhs-adpq/tree/master/documents/Images/Architecture.png)

## 4.2. Rationale

The table below lists EngagePoint's architectural design decisions and their alignment with the functional and non-functional prototype requirements.

| Application Requirements | Technologies | Motivation and rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modern Web Application | HTML5, CSS3, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) | AngularJS has decent documentation and an active GitHub community with lots of open components |
| Responsive UI | [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) | Simplifies responsive UI implementation complexity providing CSS and JS. |
| Allow foster parents to communicate with the case worker via a private inbox | [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), [HibernateORM](http://hibernate.org/orm/) | Elasticsearch implements search capabilities needed for inbox functionality like full-text search, relevancy, ranking, and fuzzy search. <br/>- We are using the relational database for the persistence of messages in the private inbox. Prototype is database agnostic. PostgreSQL is our open source choice.<br/>- Websockets technology is used for real-time notifications for new messages. |
| Allow foster parents to view children's residential facilities in their zip code | [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/projects/search/?lng=-76.67925&lat=39.01412&zoom=12) | - Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. <br/>- Mapzen Search is an open source geocoding tool used for address lookup capabilities. |
| Allow foster parents to establish and manage their profile | [JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/) [Hazelcast](http://hazelcast.org/) | - Generic JHipster application has built-in login, registration, and user profile functionality. EngagePoint has customized the generic implementation.<br/>- Hazelcast is a distributed data grid used for distributed cache capabilities and performance improvement of the application. For the prototype, we are storing user sessions as well as L2 Hibernate cache.|
| Automated deployment to IaaS, PaaS | [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) | - Spring Boot provides DevOps tools like externalized configuration, monitoring, and logging. Spring Boot eliminates the need to use external application containers, simplifying cloud deployment. <br/>- Docker containers are used for all components of application infrastructure (application, Elasticsearch server, PostgreSQL server). Containerization helps with automated deployment and makes application environments agnostic. <br/>- Jenkins is an open source tool used to implement continuous integration and delivery. |

### 4.3. Development Tools

JHipster provides tools that accelerate development and minimize custom coding. Entity Generator supports application prototyping, allowing the Technical Architect to describe the Entity Relational Diagram using JDL (domain specific language). Based on JDL, JHipster generates boilerplate code for simple CRUD operations with these entities:  [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) scripts for database objects, Hibernate entities, repository classes, Java REST resources, AngularJS controllers, REST client services, routers, unit tests for Java and JavaScript, and sample administrative UI.

The prototype has two [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) profiles: DEV and PROD. The DEV profile is used on the local development environment and incorporates in-memory H2 and Elasticsearch engines. Spring Boot provides an embedded lightweight application container, Tomcat, which runs the prototype. We used  [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and  [Spring Boot Devtools](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html) for automated reload of front-end and back-end code. These techniques reduce development time as developers view real-time updates. The PROD profile builds the prototype's production version, which is optimized for production use.

### 4.4. Automated testing

These automated testing tools ensure that the prototype meets California's requirements:

- [Junit](http://junit.org/junit4/) - Java unit tests
- [Spring Boot integration testing tools](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-testing.html) - Java integration tests
- [Karma JS](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) - JavaScript unit tests
- [Gatling](http://gatling.io/#/) - Load testing
- BDD framework  [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) - Acceptance testing

### 4.5. Deployment Approach

We used  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) as a continuous integration and delivery tool. Containerization using  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the best approach for application delivery to target environments. Please refer to  [Requirements J, L-O](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2949131) for information.

## 5. Summary

EngagePoint conducted these prototype implementation steps:

1.    Performed 1:1 interviews and documented results
2.    Developed an interactive wireframe and performed usability testing with users
3.    Developed user interface mock-ups using  [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) in compliance with [ADA508](https://www.section508.gov/)
4.    Generated a generic web application using JHipster with an appropriate technology stack
5.    Configured continuous integration and automated testing using [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
6.    Designed a data model and generated code artifacts using JHipster's entity generator
7.    Developed custom user interfaces according to design mockups and integrated them into a generic application
8.    Modified the front-end and back-end code to support ADPQ functionality

For each development stage, we created automated tests (and performance and acceptance tests) for Java and JavaScript code. [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/) controlled code quality, incorporated in an automated continuous delivery workflow that was implemented in  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/). We also manually reviewed code to ensure quality.
With this approach, we  implemented a modern, mobile friendly, cloud-ready web application in only three weeks.

Follow the link to see materials collected using each of listed technics.<br/>- [User Interview](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/01.+Interviews)<br/>- [Expert Interview](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?<br/>pageId=1212557)<br/>- [User Needs](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/02.+User+Needs)<br/>- [User Personas](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/03.+User+Personas)<br/>- [User Stories & Scenarios](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1212431)<br/>- [Wireframing](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/05.+List+of+Axure+wireframe+versions)<br/>- [Usability Testing](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/06.+Scenarios+for+usability+testing)<br/>- [Design mockups](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/08.+Pages+in+Design)<br/>In our opinion, interactive wireframes play an important part in human-centric design approach because it provides ability quickly prototype and validate design ideas with users. The interactive wireframe is an input for application development team. In such way, properly organized design stage minimizes the need to rework actual application on later stages when the cost of changes will be much more expensive for the customer.

| 7. | g. Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype -  [Dariia Iarmuratii](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cdisplay%5C~dariia.iarmuratii);  [Leonid Marushevskiy](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cdisplay%5C~admin) | Please see the [Agile Approach Overview](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cdisplay%5CAPQD%5CAgile+Approach+Overview)for the iterative process used. According to the methodology, we have used a short 2 days iteration for Design Group and 1-week iteration for application prototype development. Three times a week we had Design sessions to review wireframes, design mockups and gather feedback from team members on design artifacts. Examples of Recorded Design sessions and [meeting notes](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/Design+Sessions).Every week we have Sprint Demo meeting in order to demonstrate application prototype to Product Manager and other interested stakeholders. [M](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/Sprint+Demos) [eeting notes](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/Design+Sessions) [from Sprint.](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/Design+Sessions) According to user-centric design approach, we were focused on users input and feedback. We conducted regular interviews with defined in c. people as well as usability testing with other users. [Transcripts of interviews](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/01.+Interviews) and recordings of interviews can be found in GitHub repository. Based on user's feedback we [iteratively evolve wireframes](https://chhs-apqd.atlassian.net/wiki/display/APQD/05.+List+of+Axure+wireframe+versions).<br/>During 3 weeks of the development team have implemented tree versions of application prototype 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0. |
| 8. | h. Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design -  [Leonid Marushevskiy](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cdisplay%5C~admin),  [Dariia Iarmuratii](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cdisplay%5C~dariia.iarmuratii) | Along with wireframes for the desktop version, we also maintain wireframe for mobile version [Version 01(cell) - 05/26/2016 for Cell Phone](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cpages%5Cviewpage.action%3FpageId=1900630). Base on wireframe we produced design mockups for the mobile version. Both wireframe and design mockups become requirements for final application.In order to implement responsive UI in the application prototype, we have used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. Bootstrap is HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. It provides needed mechanisms to implement applications with user interfaces which are different depends on device resolution.   Please see the [UX Design Process](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cdisplay%5CAPQD%5CUX+Design+Process)the  [list of Axure mockups](../../C:%5Cwiki%5Cdisplay%5CAPQD%5C05.+List+of+Axure+wireframe+versions). |
