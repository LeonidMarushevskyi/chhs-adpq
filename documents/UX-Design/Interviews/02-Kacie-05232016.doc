    <h1>02. Kacie - 05/23/2016</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>Kacie as SME and Foster parent</p>
<p>She has some Foster family experience some years ago. Level of input qua=
lity - high.</p>
<p>01:20</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,153);">Why do parents of Foster kids wan=
t to communicate with a case worker using a private inbox?</span></p>
<p>Because there will&nbsp;be some confidential information that they proba=
bly don=E2=80=99t want exposed to the general public, for one. And two: via=
 a private inbox, they also have a way to have it traceable so that they ca=
n track the communication over time.</p>
<p>02:14</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Why, as parent, do I want to see a =
list of residential facilities around my home?</span></p>
<p>Because I want to know possible options where a child is going to be hou=
sed and their proximity, based on where you live. I mean from a transportat=
ion perspective, wondering to know how close they are.</p>
<p>03:41</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Can you please describe proximity o=
f residential facilities from both types of parents?</span></p>
<p>From a Biological parent, I would see using it because you are going wan=
t to know where it may be possible that they are going to be housed.</p>
<p>From Foster care perspective I would think that you will want to know in=
 terms of your facility and pickup and drop off or whatever the Foster care=
 arrangement is, you will want to know what facilities will be available to=
 you. Particularly in the case of an in-and-out arrangement where you are t=
aking a Foster kid for a temporary agreement and then you're dropping them =
back off.</p>
<p>04:59</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,153);">As Biological parent I do not kno=
w where my kid is located in most cases. What do you think from this [resid=
ential facility] perspective?</span></p>
<p>I think that you will want to know, right? The idea is that the Biologic=
al parent should have as much information as possible so long as it isn't&n=
bsp;a safety issue--like there&nbsp;are no concerns around that piece--a Bi=
ological parent should know where their child is at any given moment, and t=
hey should also have visitation rights because the idea is you don't separa=
te the child from the parent in a visitation standpoint even if you have to=
 stabilize the situation before they are returned back to the home.</p>
<p>06:28</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Describe the <span style=3D"color: =
rgb(51,51,153);">average</span> user (Sex, Age range, Experience, etc.). Ca=
n you see the difference between groups of users?</span></p>
<p>Sure. So, I think there are some commonalities: the Biological parent an=
d the Foster parent would both want to know about well-being of the child i=
n terms of health conditions, in terms of performance in the school. Those =
types of information would be common across both. I think the Biological pa=
rent would want to know what the end goal is in terms of what they can reas=
onably expect far as&nbsp;whatever issue is going in the home,&nbsp;the pla=
n to resolve that, and&nbsp;the plan to return child back to the home. Beca=
use that, for the most part that is the end goal: to stabilize the situatio=
n and keep the family together.</p>
<p>I mean the Foster parent enters into the agreement understanding that it=
's is temporary arrangement. A Biological parent looks for&nbsp;the longer-=
term plan around whatever situation needs to be stabilized and how to get k=
id back into the house.</p>
<p>08:47</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,153);">What can Foster care parents expe=
ct from this system?</span></p>
<p>I think if it=E2=80=99s were me, and I were a Foster care parent, I woul=
d expect that there is a clear line of communication about how long the chi=
ld is going to be placed in that Foster care situation. What are the expect=
ed outcomes of their more permanent situation, and if things arise is there=
 going to be additional delay or is there an additional need that emerges f=
or the child, that there is also a clear understanding of how those needs a=
re provided for. So for example, if a child was acting out in school or if =
they are having nutritional issues, each of those things I think that the F=
oster care parent needs to know going in that they are fully aware of what =
they are taking on by taking on&nbsp;that child. And there is also a clear =
reporting mechanism for how those needs are being provided for.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,153);">Changes in plan for Foster care p=
lacement. What about the map feature? Why would a Foster parent want to cal=
l?</span></p>
<p>I would want to substantiate that the place is legitimate and wherever t=
hat child is going is legitimate and credentialed. I think that's the most =
important thing. I think I would also want to know what is the communicatio=
n is between the agency and the Foster parent in terms of what is happening=
 with the child at any given moment, where are they going to be placed, and=
 what resources are available there and how the communication regularly can=
 occur.</p>
<p>11:45</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">What do you want to avoid, as&nbsp;=
Parent, using the portal?</span></p>
<p>Want to avoid miscommunication =E2=80=93 identifying issues in the home,=
 not wanting to expose information that people will potentially make an opi=
nion about and make a judgment call&nbsp;about=E2=80=93making a judgment ab=
out&nbsp;whether the child should best be in the home. If the user is the p=
arent, wanting to make sure that, as&nbsp;they communicate concerns or issu=
es, that they are properly interpreted so that the decisions that stem from=
 those communications are appropriate and not potentially jeopardizing the =
stability of the family.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,153);">Does the Foster parent need that =
too?</span></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>13:38</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">What does the user expect from this=
 product?</span></p>
<p>To be honest, if it were me, I can log in (either Biological or Foster a=
s appropriate),&nbsp;see the history of the communication,&nbsp;privately m=
essage the various parties,&nbsp;have a 360=C2=B0 view: where is the child =
at the moment, what is the plan put in place in terms of not just&nbsp;stab=
ilizing the home but also what's best for the child during that stabilizati=
on process, how long we expect it to go on for, where they are going to be =
placed, who are all the various parties involved in this interaction, schoo=
l, extracurricular activities while this is happening, duration, and outcom=
es.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Option to add pictures?</span></p>
<p>Could. Not sure if necessary.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Cell phone =E2=80=93 easy to share =
the picture =E2=80=93 useful feature?</span></p>
<p>No. What? A picture of the child?</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Some case that you have something t=
o share through the communication tool. Is that a reasonable set of feature=
s to use?</span></p>
<p>Attachments would make sense, maybe not a graphic. Attachment that needs=
 to be sent does make sense. Not seeing a picture use case. For example, th=
ey need to know the action plan =E2=80=93 proof of employment (verification=
 letter), being able to sign something on your phone would make sense.</p>
<p>18:18</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Do you want to communicate with an =
institution or a caseworker?</span></p>
<p>Depends on what is being sent. Generic things that everyone gets, do not=
 care. If I'm old school, I want it from an individual person =E2=80=93 kno=
wing their name and their phone number so that I can call them to follow up=
 if I need to and raise concerns as things arise.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Alerts?</span></p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">Fine. You should have the ability to =
dial up or dial down, to choose the notifications or not. Daily, weekly, mo=
nthly, give the user the choice.</span></p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Limiting the number of notification=
s would be useful.</span></p>
<p>Yes, profile based, I&nbsp;want to receive notifications and dictate how=
 often I want to receive these notifications.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Some critical items are notified an=
d others not.</span></p>
<p>21:17</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Is the communication feature more i=
mportant than the map?</span></p>
<p>Communication is more important. The visibility into the data is importa=
nt. The communication on the action plan and the get healthy steps is equal=
ly important.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Parent =E2=80=93 prove that you are=
 following the plan and see the communication?</span></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Archive important? Export? Print?</=
span></p>
<p>Critical to have the history log--what happened when--if something goes =
wrong you can show what happened, the steps planned and, what did or did no=
t happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>24:01</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,153);">Bio / Foster / mix (relative care=
)? Other types?</span></p>
<p>No. Recall from before: a delegated person =E2=80=93 someone who is not =
the Foster or Biological parent =E2=80=93 an authorized person to act on be=
half of the parent or Foster parent. There are legal rules around the autho=
rized representative =E2=80=93 there is a process involved. It gives that o=
ther person the legal capacity to make decisions as if they were the Biolog=
ical parent or Foster parent.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(51,51,153);">What can we expect for identifica=
tion of the people? Representative, Foster parent, and other? License numbe=
r or case number? What can we ask to&nbsp;ID the person?</span></p>
<p>Name, DOB, case number of the child, license number of Foster parent</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Security may not be strong here in =
the two weeks' work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>28:23</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">These are basic questions. I&nbsp;w=
ant to show you later how things will look and then get feedback on that.</=
span></p>
<p>Pavel, yes the questions are confusing. What would help is to think abou=
t the story. Put the child in the center. If the child is getting shipped a=
round from house to house. The story is the child who is being pulled out o=
f their house because something is going wrong, something is broken. Going =
into Foster care, new parents taking the child. Want to see the full pictur=
e. Want to see the touch points, want to see if the child has been in and o=
ut of Foster care, want to see the caseworker notes, want to see misbehavin=
g at school if that's happening, the child being delinquent--want to see th=
e full life experience.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Not just in terms of the technical =
aspects of mail, do you know of any product like this?</span></p>
<p>Multiple, SACWIS (Accenture / Deloitte), we can offer something differen=
t =E2=80=93 modular with different components.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">This is a small project to show ski=
lls for other projects. Generic communication and generic map visualization=
.&nbsp;Do you know about a Deloitte or Accenture product with communication=
?</span></p>
<p>In a previous life, I&nbsp;had exposure to some Accenture stuff. What is=
 your timeframe? What is your desired outcome?</p>
<p>34:50</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">It is an application to use from ce=
ll phone and&nbsp;tablet along with publish most project materials to the c=
loud to prove our Agile approach. Do not plan to put the conversation itsel=
f on the cloud. Put JIRA user stories. June 9 =E2=80=93 fast project. May s=
how you two versions.</span></p>
<p>Helpful to me to see the user interface. Concerned about the initial lan=
ding page, what are the things&nbsp;they care about seeing on the first pag=
e, dashboard.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Will send the link to get feedback<=
/span></p>
<p>K: Requirements to work off?</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Just the two requirements</span></p=
>
<p>K: Giggle.</p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,128);">Maybe more after asking California,=
 but maybe not. Not just put up Google mail and Google maps.</span></p>
